I created this project from Frontend Mentor. Frontend Mentor is a really cool website where you can choose different challenges to do to test your skills, and add to your portfolio.

For this project, you had to create the landing as close to the design you were given. I chose it because I really liked the colors and it looked fun. 

The techstack I used was HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Visual studio code.
